g++ -o objViewer objViewer.c++  -L/usr/lib/nvidia-340-updates -lGL -lGLU -lglut

Use the above to compile my object viewer assuming you are in the proper working directory.
Running objViewer should bring up a blank screen initially. A .obj file must be loaded for any object to be viewed. I order to do this the ':' must be typed while within the openGL window. This will bring up a prompt within the terminal. Typing 'L' followed by the .obj file location will load the object into the window.
The object should be viewed in vertices rendering. Pressing the comma and period keys while within the the openGL window will cycle between the different rendering styles.
Typing in the semicolon at any point within the openGL window should bring up a prompt from the terminal. This can be used to load and delete objects at will.
*Always remember to be within the correct window. I have often been trying to type my load command into the openGL window or trying to cycle through rendering options while in the terminal. It's kind of annoying.
